### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gustavo Lopes, also know as MysteRys337 (it's my alias anyway, so don't worry about it :P)

Since I was a kid, my biggest interest was in the computers and technologies, especially when it comes to videogames.
Right now, I am a Computer Science graduate  student, hoping that I can learn as much as I can, I order to use set abilities 
for my projects

Here is a organized list of the main things that I have worked or that I'm currently working on:

## Flutter

* [Mobile development(College work)](https://github.com/MysteRys337/LDDM-PUC2021) -> main repository 

## Java

* [Games made in Java](https://github.com/MysteRys337/EclipseJogos)
* [CRUD in Java(College work)](https://github.com/solid-titans/AEDs3) -> participated

## C++ 

* [Graphs(College work)](https://github.com/MysteRys337/graph_algorithms_in_cpp)
